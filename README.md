# 🧠 Engineering Cheatsheets

Welcome to my collection of developer-friendly **cheatsheets**! This repository is a growing set of concise, practical references covering programming languages, tools, frameworks, and engineering concepts that I’ve used or studied.

> Think of this as a “second brain” for coding – built to save time, reinforce learning, and help others.
